# GCP Infrastructure

This repository contains the Terraform infrastructure code, Kubernetes deployment manifests, and application source code for a demo project hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The application is deployed on a private Google Artifact Registry (GAR) image, running on a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster, and exposed to the public internet using a GCP HTTP Load Balancer.
